Hi everyone!
This is another way to help the world.
The Coding Coach group gathers together to plan for another fake job opening, with the purpose of learning and helping practice on job applying and interviewing. 

Currently, we planned 3 different roles, and want to simulate the processing of a job interview for those who applied in any of these 3 roles. The purpose of this mock interview is to help those people who didn’t have much experience in applying for a job or interviewing, or even you can test yourself again during this process. The Coding Coach group is to help everyone to expand and improve their knowledge and experience.

### How to apply
As we try to keep the process the same as a real job process so you need to access the jobs via the link below and apply for one role, with the required information. After that, we process with your application, simulate every step and give you feedback on each of the steps.


### How process goes
For make it clear, we have some steps in this process:
 1. You need to apply with your information, resume, and cover letter
 2. A behavioral interview takes around 20-40 minutes of a video call.
 3. Code assignment, that takes around 30 minutes
 4. Technical Interview, that takes around 30-50 minutes
 5. Evaluate and Give feedback.


Your information, interviewing process, and your evaluation keep private with us.
