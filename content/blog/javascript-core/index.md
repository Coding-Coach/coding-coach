I've been interviewing Sr Frontend Engineer for a while, and one thing I've found is that many of them fail to understand and explain JavaScript core concepts.

Among many other things, a Sr Frontend Engineer should be able to explain (in order to mentor Jr Engineers) concepts such as closures, scope, context, etc. 

Today I want to start a series of posts, where I'm going to explain in detail each individual concept. I'll be providing code examples and will try to do it as simple as possible.

### Topics to cover

- How references work in JavaScript.
- What's the difference between `==` and `===`?
- Global scope and function scope.
- Local scope, also known as block scope.
- Closures, explained in a simple way
- Context in JavaScript.
- Dinamically changing the context at runtime.

All these concepts are framework agnostic, understanding them will help you jump into any framework or library and it will definately make your live easier.

Please let me know if there's a topic you'd like me to cover in the series, I'm happy to add new topics to the list. I want to keep this course up to date, therefore I will be updating and adding new tutorials as time goes by.

As always, happy coding!
