My entire career, I have been a proponent of mentorship. It can provide an invaluable platform from which developers can share knowledge about technology as well as their careers.

Yet I quickly realized that there was no application which was able to fill this huge need.




Although there are a few platforms which can be leveraged for mentorship, they all required payment to some extent.

Mentorship should be available to everyone, regardless of circumstance, but many developers don’t have access to a mentor, or can’t afford to pay for one.

I feel as though it is my responsibility to society to help facilitate the creation of an application which will allow any developer to find a mentor.

Thus, I created Coding Coach.


## Goal
The ultimate goal of Coding Coach is to build a mentorship application which allows developers to connect with mentors worldwide and grow their skillset.

I wanted Coding Coach to be open-source. This is an issue the community is extremely passionate to help remediate, so I established this project to be a community effort.

## Phase 1: Organization
### Gauge Interest
First, I created a Google survey to get a read on where people stand in the development community, and what they would be looking for.
