I've been interviewing Sr. Frontend Engineers for a while, and one thing I've found in common is that many of them fail to understand and explain JavaScript core concepts.

Among many other things, a Sr. Frontend Engineer should be able to explain (in order to mentor Jr. Engineers) concepts such as closures, scope, context, etc. 

Today I want to start a series of posts, where I'm going to explain in detail each individual concept. I'll be providing code examples and will try to do it as simple as possible.

### Topics to cover

- How references work in JavaScript.
- What's the difference between `==` and `===`?
- Global scope and function scope.
- Local scope, also known as block scope.
- Closures, explained in a simple way
- Context in JavaScript.
- Dinamically changing the context at runtime.

All these concepts are framework agnostic, understanding them will help you jump into any framework or library and it will definately make your live easier.

Please let me know if there's a topic you'd like me to cover in the series, I'm happy to add new topics to the list. I want to keep this course up to date, therefore I will be updating and adding new tutorials as time goes by.

## Twitch Channel
We are planning to start a [twitch channel]( https://www.twitch.tv/codingcoach/) and this seems the right time to do so! I will be streaming these lessons every week, starting *Thursday Feb 13th at 5pm ET*.

I will target each episode to be about 20 mins length with a 10-15 mins of live questions from the audience. So this is a great apportunity for you to level up your JavaScript skills and improve in your career.

As always, happy coding!
